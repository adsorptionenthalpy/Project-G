2024 Mar 8 - Still working on codebase for web3 plugin godot 4.2 compatibility https://github.com/harmony-one/godot-web3-plugin/pull/1
Fixes an error with RPCRequest::request returns JSON::print(ddata))  JSON implementation was altered on newest release and no longer support JSON::print
JSON.cpp and JSON.h was carried over from godot core/io and placed in ./thirdparty and kept backwards compatible including a working port of print and _var_print methods to satisfy conditions of http request
Still having some errors with keccak_Final ands string_utils
https://github.com/harmony-one/godot-web3-plugin/pull/1

I have also started porting a rudimentary game demo over to godot 3.5 in the meantime until the plugin is updated.

2024 Feb 18 - Attempting to refactor and update the codebase to support the core changes on the newest stable version of Godot
