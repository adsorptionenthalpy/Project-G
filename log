2024 Mar 12 - work on chain force demo and testing godot blockchain interaction. tested an updated erc721 contract for minting in-game erc721 NFTs
2024 Mar 11 - continued testing of latest update of web3 plugin. Now working fully on the Chain Force demo
2024 Mar 9 - web3 plugin is now building and linking on godot 4.2. The extra JSON implementation was unnecessary and has been removed from ./thirdparty/ https://github.com/harmony-one/godot-web3-plugin/pull/2
2024 Mar 8 - Still working on codebase for web3 plugin godot 4.2 compatibility https://github.com/harmony-one/godot-web3-plugin/pull/1
Fixes an error with RPCRequest::request returns JSON::print(ddata))  JSON implementation was altered on newest release and no longer support JSON::print
JSON.cpp and JSON.h was carried over from godot core/io and placed in ./thirdparty and kept backwards compatible including a working port of print and _var_print methods to satisfy conditions of http request
Still having some errors with keccak_Final ands string_utils
https://github.com/harmony-one/godot-web3-plugin/pull/1

I have also started porting a rudimentary game demo over to godot 3.5 in the meantime until the plugin is updated.
